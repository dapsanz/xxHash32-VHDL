# xxHash32 – VHDL

This repository contains a hardware implementation of **xxHash32**, a fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm designed for high throughput and low latency. 

This project was completed in **Fall 2025** for **ECE 545: Digital System Design with VHDL** at **George Mason University**, taught by **Professor Kris Gaj**.

The design was implemented and verified by **Diego Perez Sanchez** and placed **3rd best** in a class of **20+ students**.

## Repository Overview

### specification.pdf
Contains the official project specification provided for the course. 
This document defines the required functionality, constraints, and evaluation criteria for the xxHash32 hardware implementation.

---

### deliverables/
Contains the complete set of materials submitted for the course, including:
- Design documentation
- Block diagrams
- ASM charts
- VHDL source code
- Verification infrastructure
- Timing analysis
- Final implementation results

All source code in this folder corresponds to the **submitted and graded version** of the project. 
The design is **fully functional and verified** according to the project requirements.

---

## Project Status and Future Work

Although the submitted design is functionally correct and fully verified, it can be further improved in terms of architecture, performance, and maintainability.

An updated and improved version of the design is planned and will be added to this repository in a separate folder in the future, without modifying the original submitted deliverables.

---

## Notes
- The contents of `deliverables/` reflect the final academic submission.
- Future updates will preserve the original graded version.
- This README was generated with the assistance of AI and reviewed and verified by the author; all design, implementation, and analysis work in this repository is the author’s own.
